BoOkEr_GameJam2014
==================

My first attempt to create a game in Java in less than 48 hours for GameJam 2014. It's still a work in progress!

To run:

1) Compile everything and run the RunGame.java file from command prompt. It should make the start game window appear.
    On this panel, there should be a button labeled "Start Game." 

2) Click the "Start Game" button. The next JPanel should load immediately after.

3) Game characters (hand-drawn by yours truly on her tablet-phone, the Galaxy Note 2) should appear. 

...this is as far as I've gotten. It's very different from anything I'd ever done with Java in class and 
though it's not up and running like a regular game yet, it amuses me that I could get Java to do this.

On a last note: forgive my poorly commented code!
